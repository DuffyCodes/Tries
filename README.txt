This was code I wrote for a school project. My code is the tree.cpp file.
To use, compile and from a command line, feed a list of words (i.e. ./tree < example.txt)
It should proccess a large list within a few seconds, finding the largest suffix that appears more than once (listing, calling, sitting would spit out 'ting')
